# proteomic_NMJ_enrichment
R scripts used to analyse human ageing muscle and NMJ-enriched samples following proteomic quantification. For example how to create an annotated heatmap using R's Pheatmap package and save it as a scalable vector graphic to make final layout edits in e.g. Affinity Designer or Photoshop for final publication quality figures.
